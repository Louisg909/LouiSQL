# LouiSQL
Simple, light weight SQL Clone inside Python for database querying.

# Why?
Was working on SQLAlchemy in an assessment and realised how clunky and hard to use it was, and was enjoying using SQL so decided to make my own python interpritation of it. May not be as feature-filled, but hopefully will be a lot simpler and straightforward to use.
